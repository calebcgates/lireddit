req.session.userId = user.id;

{UserId:1} -> send that to redis

redis is a key value store. this could be an example key
1.
sess:qalsdjkfa;lsdjflasjdf -> {userId: 1}

2.
express-session will set a cookie on my browser asdlfjadsfasdfghjkeriuwec

3.
when user makes a request
asdlfjadsfasdfghjkeriuwec -> sent to the server

4.
on server, this cookie value is unsigned / decrypted using the secret that we defined in the code (that should be added to ENV variables)
asdlfjadsfasdfghjkeriuwec -> sess:qalsdjkfa;lsdjflasjdf

5.
makes a request to redis
sess:qalsdjkfa;lsdjflasjdf -> {userId: 1}

6.
